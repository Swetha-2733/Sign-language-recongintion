# Sign Language Recognition

This project is a **Sign Language Recognition** system that uses machine learning/deep learning to recognize and interpret various hand gestures associated with sign language. The goal of this project is to provide an assistive tool that can bridge the communication gap for people with hearing and speech impairments by translating sign language into text.

## Introduction

Sign language recognition is a field of artificial intelligence that aims to enable computers to understand sign language gestures. This project leverages image processing and deep learning to classify hand signs into their corresponding meanings, helping to facilitate smoother communication with sign language users.

## Features

- **Real-time sign language recognition** using a webcam.
- **Accurate classification** of various sign language gestures.
- **Pre-trained model** or **custom model training** options.
- **Visualization tools** to display predictions.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sign-language-recognition.git
   cd sign-language-recognition
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Ensure you have Python installed, then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the Dataset:**
   - Download your dataset and place it in the `data/` folder.
   - Alternatively, you can specify a different path in the notebook.

## Usage

1. **Run the Notebook:**
   Open and execute the cells in the Jupyter Notebook to train the model or use a pre-trained model to recognize signs:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook sign_language.ipynb
   ```

2. **Model Inference:**
   - Follow the instructions within the notebook to load a video feed (such as a webcam) and start recognizing sign language gestures in real-time.

3. **Training a Custom Model:**
   - Modify the notebook to train a model with your own dataset.
